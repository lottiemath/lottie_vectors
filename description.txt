This is a 'route' and 'force' display for 2 dimensional vectors over a coordinate space which though displays the data in 2D uses the Z for the force component when the display is rotated by the user.


The data can be in a mix of forms, and is given to the program as two simple 2xn matrices. One for the position vectors, and another that can be used to display a 'force' acting on that position. Both matrices must be the same length in this version. You can display more than one force at a position by using a zero magitude on the next position vector.

Both matrices can contain a mix of data in the following forms  :

0 = ignore vector 
1 = vector is a global carteisen coordinate as position
2 = vector  is a relative carteisen coordinate to the position
3 = vector  is a magnitude first then global angle in degrees
4 = vector  is a magnitude first then global angle in radians
5 = vector  is a magnitude first then relative angle in degrees
6 = vector  is a magnitude first then relative angle in radians


QUICK START

Set the number of vectors with

nombre_de_vecteurs = 2;


for 2 vectors, then add the vector data for the positions

vector_positions = [ 3, 45, 100,
